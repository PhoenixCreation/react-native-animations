# Welcome to React-native-animations üëã

> This is compilation of animations made by &#34;Phoenix&#34;. Some of them are very dumb so don't be so serious about this.

## üõë IMPORTANT üõë

- This project is on halt and is going in direction of being dropped because some older animations are done in reanimated-alpha version and switching to more stable version is causing crashes. So this project might get extension as a `react-native-animations-2` when react-native-reanimated@2.0.0 will become fully supported in expo sdk.
- Also the last project `SpotTube` is continued on saprate repo here -> https://github.com/PhoenixCreation/SpotTube
- Sorry for inconvince.

## Installation

```sh
yarn install
```

OR

```sh
npm install
```

- You will require either npm or yarn's latest verisons installed.
- In addition to it you will need expo-cli installed at current location.

## Usage

```sh
yarn start
```

OR

```sh
npm start
```

- There is very high chances that app keeps crashing due to some animation related issues.
- Most commmon fix will be to switch react-native-reanimatd library's version to `2.0.0-alpha.6.1`
